 *   1. `useFluxionStream` — live pump that pushes to the chart layer while
 *      live, always records into the session.
 *   2. `useChartReplay` — backfills + streams the chart from a DVR
 *      player. Trailing window `[t - windowMs, t]`.
 *   3. `useChartLiveBackfill` — on every DVR→live transition, wipes the
 *      chart and rewrites it with the most recent `windowMs` of recorded
 *      data so the live chart picks up seamlessly.
 *   4. `isLiveRef` — defeats the stale-closure window during an in-flight
 *      `dvr.enter()`, so live pushes don't leak past the mode switch.
 *
 * @example
 * useChartReplayBridge({
 *   host, session, dvr, isLive: !dvr.isDvr,
 *   channel: signalChannel,
 *   windowMs: 5_000, timeOrigin,
 *   produce: (wallT) => ({ name: "signal", value: sampleAt(wallT) }),
 *   pickValue: (d) => d.value,
